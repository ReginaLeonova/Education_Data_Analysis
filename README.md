Understanding how study habits, motivation, and external factors affect students' exam results.
Overall, the analysis suggests that individual effort and consistency play a much greater role in students’ academic performance than external factors such as school type, teacher quality, or family income.
The strongest predictors of high exam scores are study time and attendance. Students who dedicate more hours to studying and maintain regular attendance tend to achieve the best results, regardless of their motivation level, socioeconomic status, or access to resources.
While tutoring and parental involvement can provide additional support, they cannot substitute for personal discipline and self-study. Tutoring appears most effective for students who already study regularly but less impactful for those with low study engagement. Similarly, access to educational resources mainly benefits highly active learners.
Some findings challenge common expectations — for example, students with less sleep sometimes outperformed their peers, possibly due to spending more time studying. However, there’s no strong correlation between sleep duration and performance once motivation and attendance are considered.
Environmental and social factors such as teacher quality, school type, or family income showed little influence, whereas positive peer influence and high parental involvement clearly enhanced results. Students with learning disabilities achieved strong scores when supported by both parents and tutors.
Finally, proximity to school has a minor effect: students living nearby tend to perform better, yet high attendance (rather than distance) remains the real differentiator.
In summary, consistent study habits and attendance are the key drivers of academic success, while external support systems act as secondary amplifiers rather than primary determinants.
