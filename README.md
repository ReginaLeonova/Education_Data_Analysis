Education Data Analysis

Objective:
Understanding how study habits, motivation, and external factors affect students’ exam performance.

Summary:
The analysis shows that individual effort and consistency have a far greater impact on students’ academic success than external conditions such as school type, teacher quality, or family income.

Key Insights:
Study time and attendance are the strongest predictors of high exam scores. Students who study regularly and attend classes consistently tend to achieve the best results, regardless of motivation level or background.
Tutoring and parental involvement provide valuable support but cannot replace self-discipline and personal study effort. Tutoring is most effective for students who are already engaged learners.
Access to educational resources benefits active learners more than passive ones.
Some findings challenge common assumptions — for example, students who sleep less sometimes outperform their peers, likely due to spending more time studying. However, once motivation and attendance are factored in, sleep duration shows no strong correlation with performance.
Environmental and social factors such as school type or teacher quality have limited influence, whereas positive peer interactions and strong parental involvement clearly enhance results.
Students with learning disabilities perform well when supported by both parents and tutors.
Proximity to school has a minor effect: students living closer tend to perform slightly better, but attendance remains the decisive factor.
Conclusion:
Consistent study habits and class attendance are the primary drivers of academic success. External factors — like tutoring, resources, and family support — act as amplifiers rather than determinants of performance.
