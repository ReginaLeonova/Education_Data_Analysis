🎓 Education Data Analysis

🎯 Goal
Investigate how study habits, motivation, and external factors influence students’ exam performance.
The analysis was conducted using the Education_Data_Analysis dataset.

🧠 Hypothesis
Students who study more consistently and attend classes regularly achieve higher exam results, regardless of socioeconomic background or school type.

📊 Findings
The analysis shows that individual effort and consistency have a far stronger impact on academic performance than external conditions such as school quality, teacher effectiveness, or family income.
Study time and attendance are the most reliable predictors of success.
Students who study regularly and maintain high attendance outperform peers across all motivational and socioeconomic levels.
Tutoring and parental involvement improve results but cannot replace personal discipline and self-study. Their effect is strongest among already engaged students.
Access to resources primarily benefits motivated learners rather than compensating for low engagement.
Contrary to expectations, sleep duration showed little correlation once motivation and attendance were accounted for.
Positive peer influence and parental support significantly enhance results, while school proximity has only a minor indirect effect via attendance.

⚠️ Key Insight:
Consistent study habits and attendance are the primary drivers of academic success, while external supports act as amplifiers rather than determinants.
